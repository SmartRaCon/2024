## Short Bio

José Bacelar Almeida currently an Assistant Professor at the Department of Informatics at Universidade do Minho and researcher at HASLab/INESC TEC. He obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science from this university in 2003. His research interests lie in Cryptography  and Information Security and its intersection with Program Verification. 

He has been working on the development of high-assurance cryptographic implementations for the last 10 years, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical security and real-world security. He is particularly interested in provable security and its interplay with the formal verification of cryptographic proofs and cryptographic software implementations.
