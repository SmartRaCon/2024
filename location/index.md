FACS 2022 will be held online.  The talks will be given over Zoom, feedback and discussion from the audience will make use of Zoom's Q&A functionality.  Audience members who submit a question will be unmuted for follow-up questions.

Online coffee breaks will be held on [wonder.me](https://www.wonder.me){:target="_blank"}, where it is possible to form ad-hoc groups to talk one-on-one or in small groups.
